## Cloud Focused MITRE Tactics & Techniques 
Rather than document the entire MITRE framework I thought I would highlight a few cloud specific IDs.

=== "Discovery - TA0007"
Learning information about your environment.

    Cloud Service Discovery (T1526) - using a cloud API service to identify what services are available.
    Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580) - Looking for resources that are a part of the service.
    Cloud Storage Object Discovery (T1619) - enumerating objects within cloud storage.

=== "Defense Evasion - TA0005"
    
    Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure (T1578) - modify compute service to evade defense.
